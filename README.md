Plotted the average precipitation and temperature map using the netcd4 file

By ploting i got to know about the new libraries like netcdf4 , matpltlib basemap, pil

The CRU TS series of data sets (CRU TS = Climatic Research Unit Timeseries) contain monthly timeseries of precipitation, daily maximum and minimum temperatures, cloud cover, and other variables covering Earth's land areas for 1901-2020 . The data set is gridded to 0.5x0.5 degree resolution, based on analysis of over 4000 individual weather station records. Many of the input records have been homogenized, but the data set itself is not strictly homogeneous.

It is not a new Idea/project .But surfed the internet and learned a lot during the project.
